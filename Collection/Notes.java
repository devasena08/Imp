     * 
     * Collections is a framework
     * Collections framework has collection interface....is the superinterface
     * collection is a group of objects ....is also called elements
     * some have duplicates and some do not have dup
     * some are ordered and some are unondered
     * jdk does not provide any direct implement of the this interface (Collection)
     * ie..interface class vachu dhn implement pana mudiyum,...here they are saying like
     * no implementation of interface in direct nu..apo class direct ah illa nu meaning
     * apo interface vachu ena seiya mudiyum..without class nra questin varum
     * 
     * Ans:-Collection interface provides sub interface is Set and list(Sub interface of collection)
     * 
     * Set and list  oda  super interface Collection
     * Collection oda super interface is Interable
     * 
     * not only set , list, colllection interface also has sub inerfaces like map, queue....but, we now, take 
     * a detailed look of set and  list
     * 
     * Set has no dublicates
     * Set has no order
     * 
     * list is ordered
     * list has duplicates
     * 
     * set and list are sub interfaces....to implement this we have classes like
     * 
     * Classes  are...ArrayList , Linked List, Stack , Vector
     * 
     * Only one interface ku en evlo classes...Bcz, each class diff features
     * 
     *  No primitive datatypee is allowed in collections
     *
