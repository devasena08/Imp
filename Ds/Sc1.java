     * Asymptotic analysis
     *  used to determine the time and space
     *  if input inceases..then memory nad time to process also icreases
     * 
     * Asymptotic notations
     * 
     *  Best Case
     *  Worst Case
     *  Avg Case
     * 
     * Notations are  :-
     *  Omega------> lower bound(lower time required)----> Best case
     * EX- If we can certain algo takes 100 secs as best amount of time.
     * So, 100 sec will be lower bound,,The algo can tkae more than 100s but it not take less than 100 sec
     *  Big O------> upper bound----> worst case
     *  Theta------> lower  & upper bound(avg time required)----> Best case
