class Notes_Poly{
    /*
     * polymorphism means many forms
     * has two type...method overloading and overriding
     * overloadng means..same method name having diff no of arguments and diff datatype
     * in this, only object will take diff forms to execute the methods in complie time..
     * bcz, it decides which method is first to execute in compile time itself..and that is static..we cant change
     * Method Overloading is Complie time poly / Static 
     * overriding means..same method name having same  arguments and same datatype 
     * in this, diff objects which method is to called is decided by the object at the runtime
     * bcz, it decides which method is first to execute in run time itself..and that is dynamic..
     * Method Overloading is Complie time poly / Static
     * child classs give own defintion than parent class is method overriding
