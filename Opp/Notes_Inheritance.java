     Code Reusability: The code written in the Superclass is common to all subclasses. 
     Child classes can directly use the parent class code.
     Method Overriding: Method Overriding is achievable only through Inheritance. 
     It is one of the ways by which Java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.
