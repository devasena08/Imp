public class Notes_Interface {
    /*
     * Interface is a contract
     * it acheives 100% abstraction
     * ie all the methods are abstract in default...no need to mention actract keyword
     * no methods will have method declaration only defintion will be there
     * java does not support multiple inheritance...but interface indirectly support multiple inheritance
     * u cant create object for interface
     * all instance methods except the default and static methods have only method declaration
     * default methods can be overridden
     * static methods can be accessed using interface name
